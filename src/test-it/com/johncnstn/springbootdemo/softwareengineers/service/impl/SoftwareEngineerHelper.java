/*
 üß™ Test-only helper registered with Spring via @TestComponent

 ‚úÖ Why @TestComponent?
    - Automatically registered in the Spring test context (like @Component but test-scoped)
    - No need to manually @Import or define a @Bean in test configs
    - Cleanly injects into test classes using constructor injection
    - Keeps test setup reusable, DRY, and isolated from production

 üß∞ Purpose:
    - Provides utility methods for creating and clearing test entities (SoftwareEngineer)
    - Centralizes repeated test setup logic (e.g., default test engineer, tech stack)
    - Improves readability and maintainability across integration test classes

 üìå Test usage:
    - Inject with @Autowired or @TestConstructor in test classes
    - Recommended for integration tests involving service + repo layers

 üß™ Deterministic test data:
    - Fixed name + tech stack ensure stable, predictable test behavior
    - Avoids flaky tests and simplifies debugging

 üîÑ Use `clear()` to reset DB state after tests
    - Call from @AfterEach or @AfterAll in integration tests
    - Prevents test data leakage and ensures isolation
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious in parallel test execution‚Äîshared DBs might conflict

 ‚öôÔ∏è Compatible with test DBs like H2 or PostgreSQL (Testcontainers)
    - Assumes clean schema and isolated data state
    - Designed for safe use in Spring Boot integration tests

 üöÄ Performance tip:
    - Use helper only where needed; avoid unnecessary DB writes
    - Keep test data minimal and targeted per test case

 ‚ùå Not used in production:
    - `@TestComponent` ensures it won‚Äôt be accidentally picked up by main app context
    - Safer than @Component for test scaffolding
