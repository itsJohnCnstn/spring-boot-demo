/*
 ðŸ”„ This class serves as a manual mapping layer between internal domain models (entities) and external-facing DTOs.

 âœ… Why use a mapper class at all?
    - **Separation of concerns**: isolates transformation logic away from service/controller layers.
    - Keeps your domain model clean from serialization details.
    - Supports **flexibility** in the future (e.g., if DTO shape diverges from entity).
    - Central point to add transformation logic (e.g., date formatting, enum conversion, derived fields).

 âœ… Why not use libraries like MapStruct or ModelMapper?
    - Manual mapping is:
        â€¢ More **explicit and predictable**
        â€¢ Easier to debug
        â€¢ Safer for refactors (compile-time checked)
    - Ideal for small/medium projects where automatic mappers are overkill

 âœ… Why annotate with @Component?
    - Makes the mapper available as a Spring bean for **dependency injection**
    - Promotes **testability** and **reuse** in service layers

 ðŸ§  Notes:
    - You typically map:
        1. DTO â†’ Entity (for create/update persistence)
        2. Entity â†’ DTO (for API responses)

 ðŸ“¦ `toDTO(...)`
    - Converts internal entity into a DTO to be returned via API or service call

 ðŸ“¦ `toEntity(...)`
    - Combines external input (e.g., `SoftwareEngineerToCreateDTO`) with backend-generated `id`
    - Constructs a clean domain entity ready to persist or process internally

 ðŸ’¡ Design tip:
    - If mappings get complex, consider separate mappers for each direction.
    - Avoid using DTOs directly inside your domain logic â€“ treat them as boundaries between layers.
