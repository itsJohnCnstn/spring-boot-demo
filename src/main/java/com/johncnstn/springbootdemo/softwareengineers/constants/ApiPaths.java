 âœ… Utility class for defining centralized REST API paths.
 âœ… Declared abstract with a private constructor to prevent instantiation and inheritance.

 ðŸ§  Why static constants here:
    - Promotes consistency across controllers, tests, docs
    - Avoids scattering hardcoded strings
    - Makes global path refactors (e.g., version upgrades) trivial
